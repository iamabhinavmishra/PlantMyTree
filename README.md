# PlantMyTree
Plant My Tree app
As Global Warming is rising we need to plant more trees. People do want to plant trees but they don’t have the luxury of time and place to plant trees, so we are introducing the “Plant My Trees App”.
Plant My Tree App will allow the user to buy plants and it will get planted. the geolocation of the plant will be shared with the user so that the user can track the plant whenever they need it.
